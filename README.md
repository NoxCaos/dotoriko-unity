# .Oriko - a Unity3D Framework

Despite Unity is a massive game engine that contains a lot of stuff to make life of game developer easy, there are no some useful stuff that we use almost in every game.

**.Oriko Framework** contains useful utilities to reduce developer's pain of implementing some functionality. Furthermore this framework allows you to structure your game using MVC, create sequances with Finite State Machine, use own Event System and many more. It's time to improve your indie projects!

### Why not asset store?

Usually you can see stuff like this on Unity Asset Store for $60 and more. I think that this code can be improved and optimized a lot. Also I would like other developers to add new component that they think are used frequently.

### Installing

> Note, that **.Oriko** works with **Unity 4.6+**  because of new UI system

In **Assets** folder of your Unity project
```sh 
    git clone https://github.com/NoxCaos/dotoriko-unity.git
```
Download and import [Newtonsoft.Json] from **Bin/Net20**

That's it! You are ready to start. 

### Usage

Check out README files in every folder. You can find out about namespace, classes, interfaces and how to use them.

### Version **0.7.5**
